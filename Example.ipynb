    "The main motivations for this project were three-fold. Firstly, we aimed to explore and apply novel models in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as OpenAI embedding and MPNet from Hugging Face. Secondly, we sought to develop an application that is specifically tailored for job search. Upon inputting a job title, users would be able to obtain a list of the closest task descriptions associated with that particular job title. Lastly, we aimed to experiment with two different methods of deploying our application - Github pages and Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for this project came from a personal experience, where one of our team members received a suggestion from an employer to consider coordinator positions that were suitable for her resume and skills. However, she had never considered or looked for such positions before. This sparked the idea of developing an application that would be beneficial not only to her, but also to the thousands of people who are starting their career and looking for job opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we were inspired by a lecture by Professor Ran Feldish, where he presented an application that uses OpenAI embedding to match products with product descriptions (https://github.com/ShawnTXin/openai-embeddings). This motivated us to use a similar approach, but with a different objective - matching job titles with job descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was obtained from ONET Resource Center (https://www.onetcenter.org/), specifically the Task Statements Database, which provides a mapping of ONET-SOC codes (occupations) to tasks associated with the occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will first explore OpenAI embedding and then experiment with MPNet sentence transformer."

Based on the recommendation from OpenAI, we used the \"text-embedding-ada-002\" model for nearly all use cases, and we found it to be better, cheaper, and simpler to use. However, we did encounter some issues with the computation time, which could be attributed to the size of our dataset (19265 sentences) and the computing power of our device. To validate this, we tested the model on a smaller sample size of 1000 sentences, and it was much faster.\n",
